# Quantitative Approaches to Larval Biology\: Selected topics and executable examples

This is an [executable book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) presenting applications of quantitative reasoning to gain insights into important questions in larval biology research.
The subjects and model implementations derive from my research and courses I taught. 
In particular, most models in this book are drawn from the Larval Biology course at Friday Harbor Laboratories, where I was very fortunate to learn from the astonishing depth and breadth of knowledge of his my long-term co-instructors, Richard Strathmann and Richard Emlet; numerous other resident and visiting investigators; and, many gifted and hardworking students. 
All these scientists are co-contributors to the (good parts) of this book.

Most topics and examples focus on the larvae of marine invertebrates (a few focus on marine vertebrates).
However, the ideas in this book have broader application -- Larval Biology is highly interdisciplinary, centered in organismal biology spanning many aspects of ecology, evolution, functional morphology and biomechanics, physiology, genetics, oceanography, climate science, environmental policy and management, and many other fields.
Key questions in Larval Biology are closely related to questions in other biological subdisciplines.
It is the interdisciplinarity and applicability of Larval Biology that motivates this book, and dictates its emphasis on quantitative tools and executable models.

## Why use models in Larval Biology?
Larval Biology is historically a mostly experimental disciplne. 
Larval Biologists have frequently pushed technological boundaries, for example in confocal and other computerized imaging techniques, and in molecular techniques to identify species, measure population connectivity and understand patterns of development.
Mathematical models have contributed to discussions in a variety of debates in Larval Biology, for example in Life History Evolution questions concerning the evolution of egg size.
However, the potential of mathematical tools to contribute to Larval Biology is much broader and deeper than the literature reflects.
Disseminating some of the background knowledge and experience for using models, and the understanding of why using models is a productive adjunct to traditional approaches in Larval Biology, is a primary objective of this book. 
A future Larval Biology in which the potential of models to enhance discovery is more fully exploited -- in which quantitative models are freely interdigitated among empirical methods and observations -- would be a more interesting, productive and impactful discipline.

A few of the reasons Larval Biologists might be interested in quantitative models are:

***Models are tools for inferring the logical consequences of specific assumptions.***

The emphasis here is on "specific". 
In a career of modeling biological processes in which I believed I was well versed, and of helping other biologists to formulate models in their own areas of expertise, I have consistently encountered two phenomena:

Formulating a mathematical model requires *specificity* in details that are easy to overlook in conceptual thinking\: Exactly *how* is a process like morphogenesis, coordinated reproduction, predator avoidance or gene flow regulated? In what way is an egg, an early embryo, a larva and an adult "individuals" in a population model? I have been frequently shocked to discover basic aspects I had never thought about in organismal systems I thought I knew well.
Writing down a quantitative model, even if the results are never calculated, exposes these details and the wonderful new insights and questions that arise from them.

Different scientists, especially scientists from different disciplines, use the *same word with very different meanings*. 
This means that interdisciplinary collaborations, which are necessary and productive in Larval Biology, are frequently derailed by misunderstandings between two experts who have firm, well-founded (but different) interpretations of the subject at hand.
An example is "memory". 
To a mathematician or statistician, a "memoryless system" is one in which the current state determines the probabilities of future events, without regard to how the current state was brought about. 
Thus, a mathematician could happily formulate a "memoryless" model of the human brain.

Clearly, this would not be a biologist's interpretation.
Confounding vocabulary and other vagueness in terminology is usually clarified when the relevant biological mechanisms are expressed in mathematical form.

***Models are tools for inferring what we want to know from what we can measure.***
Larval Biology is rife with facts that we want to know but can't directly measure. 
What are the fitness implications of variants we observe in morphology, size, behavior, geography, or seasonality?
How are environmental signals transduced into reproductive, 

***Models are tools for communicating biological knowledge across organisational levels.***
