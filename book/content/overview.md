# Quantitative Approaches to Larval Biology\: Selected topics and executable examples

This is an [executable book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) presenting applications of quantitative reasoning to gain insights into important questions in Larval Biology research.
The subjects and model implementations derive from my research and courses I taught. 
In particular, most models in this book are drawn from the Larval Biology course at Friday Harbor Laboratories, where I was very fortunate to learn from the astonishing depth and breadth of knowledge of his my long-term co-instructors, Richard Strathmann and Richard Emlet; numerous other resident and visiting investigators; and, many gifted and hardworking students. 
All these scientists are co-contributors to (the good parts of) this book.

Most topics and examples focus on the larvae of marine invertebrates (a few focus on marine vertebrates, a few are more general).
However, most of the ideas in this book have broader application -- Larval Biology is highly interdisciplinary, centered in organismal biology spanning many aspects of ecology, evolution, functional morphology and biomechanics, physiology, genetics, oceanography, climate science, environmental policy and management, and many other fields.
Key questions in Larval Biology are closely related to questions in other biological subdisciplines.
It is the interdisciplinarity and applicability of Larval Biology that motivates this book, and dictates its emphasis on quantitative tools and executable models.
These motivations and emphases may make the book useful to investigators in other biological disciplines, or provide an example of how to develop tools specific to their interests.
