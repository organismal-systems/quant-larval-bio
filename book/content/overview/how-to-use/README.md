# How to use this book

This book is organized into Parts, each devoted to a different general topic or biological research area (e.g., Biomechanics, Demography, etc.).
Each Part contains Chapters which present, in context, one or more models within the general topic. 
"In context" means that these examples provide brief background (with additional outside references); a working "executable" model; instructions how to use that model and suggested activities for exploring potential implications of the model for Larval Biology

In most cases, background is presented in short form, on separate "Quick Explainer" pages. 
These pages are intended to be short enough for a reader to internalize the most relevant, essential facts about a topic refered to in a model, without losing continuity of thought in working with that model.
Quick Explainers are not intended to be comprehensive, though ideally they may refer to additional sources.
In many cases the most useful reference is simply a link to Wikipedia, which has proven to be be comprehensive and accurate in many areas of mathematics, physics and statistics.

Models, instructions on how to use them, and activities applying the models to currently relevant questions in Larval Biology are presented in Jupyter notebooks. 
Jupyter notebooks are among the latest and (so far) best platforms for embedding working computer code with formatted text and graphical content. 
Jupyter notebooks can be combined and integrated with Markdown and other content in the form of an Executable Book.
Jupyter books can be run on a reader's own computer, can be run online on platforms such as Binder, and can be freely exported using a drop-down menu as a static (non-executable) PDF document.
With additional setup, Jupyter books can also be exported as a LaTeX document, and then reconverted to a variety of other formats.
This flexibility in format and usage makes Jupyter books the best platform, at the time of this writing, for a book aimed at helping Larval Biologists gain experience working with models.
